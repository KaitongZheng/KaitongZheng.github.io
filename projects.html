									<h2>As a student</h2>
									<p> 
										During my graduate period, I studied at Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. My tutors were Jinqiu Sang, Chengshi Zheng and Xiaodong Li.
										My research interest was "room acoustic parameters estimation using deep learning".
										I also studied about speech enhancement, microphone array signal processing (DAS, MVDR, LCMV, GSC...), 
										spatial audio (HRTF, upmixing...), and I was familiar with different acoustical experiments.
										I mainly used matlab and python.
										<br>
										<br>

										<b>Blind estimation of room acoustic parameters based on deep learning (Project of my Master thesis) </b>
										<br>
										This project aims to use deep learning to estimate acoustic parameters such as reverberation time from noisy reverberant speech signals.
										<ul>
											<li>Carried out in-depth literature research on room acoustics, speech signal processing and deep learning theories.</li>
											<li>Innovatively used speech enhancement algorithms to improve the estimation accuracy in noisy environments.</li>
											<li>proposed a method to simulate more realistic impulse responses with conditional GAN.</li>
										</ul>

										<b>Emotional music generation using Recurrent Neural Network </b>
										<br>
										This project aims to use deep learning to generate music given a specified emotion.
										<ul>
											<li>Improved the traditional emotional music generation method based on emotional labels, and implemented a music generation algorithm based on music theory.</li>
											<li>Carried out a subjective listening test and analyzed the experimental results to check the effectiveness of
												the algorithm, some statistical analysis has been conducted.</li>
										</ul>

										<b>Research on room equalization methods </b>
										<br>
										This project aims to automatically EQ the sound rendering caused by the multipath effect of the room.
										<ul>
											<li>Implemented equalization methods based on IIR filter, LMS algorithm, MINT, all-pole model, etc.</li>
											<li>Used the measured room impulse response to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm in a real environment.</li>
										</ul>

									<h2>As a developer in iFlytek</h2>
									My work is to finish the prototype of algorithms using matlab and implement them in C for practical use.
									The algorithms mainly serve for the in-car audio entertainment system.
									<br>

										<b>Noise-dependent music gain compensation in automotive </b>
										<br>
										In cars, there are often multiple loudspeakers that can play surround sound music. However, external noises can negatively impact the user's listening experience. When the noise increases, users often need to manually increase the music volume to hear it clearly. Conversely, when the noise decreases, users often need to manually decrease the music volume to prevent it from being too piercing. Frequent volume adjustments not only significantly affect the user's driving experience but also pose serious safety hazards.
										<br> Therefore, a noise-dependent music gain compensation method is proposed, which can automatically adjust the volume of loudspeakers based on noise level.
										<ul>
											<li>6 channel AEC to avoid the effect of 5.1 music.</li>
											<li>Noise power spectral density estimation using minimun statistics.</li>
											<li>Gain compensation with dynamic volume tracing.</li>
											<li>Audio Compressor.</li>
											
										</ul>

										<b>Road noise control (RNC) in automotive </b>
										<br>
										In cars, low-frequency
										noise sources are difficult to control using conventional
										passive methods without the addition of considerable
										weight in the form of damping materials or body
										stiffening. Using loudspeakers as secondary sources, active
										sound control offers the possibility of attenuating lowfrequency
										interior noise significantly.
										<br> Therefore, a road noise control method is implemented, which can adaptively reduce the low-frequency noise.
										<ul>
											<li>Secondary paths identification.</li>
											<li>Time domain and frequency domain multi-channel Fx-lms algorithm.</li>
											
										</ul>

										<b>Basic automotive audio algorithms </b>
										<br>
										Equalizer, dynamic range control algorithm, virtual surround sound algorithm etc.
										<br>
										<br>

										All algorithms were tested in matlab and implemented in C by myself.
